# 🔥 Fire Emergency Reporting API

The Fire Emergency Reporting API enables users to report fire incidents by providing location details, images, and descriptions. This API then sends an SMS notification to the fire agency via Twilio, alerting them to the emergency details and location. The API is suitable for integration into mobile or web applications focused on community safety and emergency response.

## ✨ Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure authentication for reporting users.
- **Report Submission**: Users can report an incident by providing:
  - Address
  - Description of the incident
  - Location coordinates (latitude & longitude)
  - Optional image upload of the incident.
- **Automated SMS Alerts**: A Twilio-powered SMS notification is sent to the agency, detailing the incident’s address, reporter’s information, and a link to the geolocation.
- **Admin Support**: Admin users can view reports and receive notifications to respond efficiently.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Node.js** and **Express** for server-side logic
- **MongoDB** for data storage
- **Multer** for image handling
- **Twilio** for SMS messaging
- **AWS S3** or other storage solutions (optional) for storing incident images

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based)
- Twilio account (for SMS)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devabdulsalam/firefly.git
   cd firefly
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (see below for configuration).

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🔐 Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root and include the following:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_database_uri
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER=admin_phone_number_to_receive_alerts
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name (optional)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
```

## 📋 API Endpoints

### 1. Report Fire Incident
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/report`
- **Description**: Submit a report with incident details, location, and an optional image.
- **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **Body Parameters**:
  - `address` (string) – required
  - `description` (string) – required
  - `latitude` (number) – required
  - `longitude` (number) – required
  - `image` (file) – optional (JPEG/PNG)
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "report": {
      "id": "string",
      "userId": "string",
      "address": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "imageUrl": "string",
      "latitude": "number",
      "longitude": "number",
      "createdAt": "date"
    },
    "message": "Incident reported successfully"
  }
  ```
  
### 2. Send Emergency SMS Notification
After submitting a report, an SMS message is automatically sent to the agency’s phone number.

- **Description**: This function is triggered upon report submission.
- **Details Sent**:
  - Reporter’s name and phone
  - Incident address
  - Description
  - Link to Google Maps coordinates for exact location

## 🛑 Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON with an appropriate HTTP status code:
- `400`: Bad Request (e.g., missing required fields)
- `401`: Unauthorized (e.g., invalid token)
- `404`: Not Found (e.g., user or admin not found)
- `500`: Internal Server Error

Example error response:
```json
{
  "error": "Description of the error"
}
```

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Implement push notifications for quicker response times.
- Enable geolocation-based incident clustering to prioritize emergency response.
- Add logging and analytics to monitor response times and incident frequency.
